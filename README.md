Hi, I am Kallie.

I am a recent graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Go Heels!) where I studied econometrics and data sciences.
My interest in data has allowed me to learn about statistical and machine-learning analyses.
I am currently learning about the predictive capabilities of AI through personal projects and studies pertaining to health data.
I can be reached through LinkedIn or my business email kalliopejlb@gmail.com.
